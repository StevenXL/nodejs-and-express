# NodeJS and Express

This repository is meant as a learning exercise, as I follow along with the
[PluralSight Course Building Web Applications with Node.js and Express 4.0][1].

I have separated the course into a few different branches in order to explore
different technologies, such as using Jade, Handlebars, or EJS as templating
engines.
